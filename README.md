# LAME
Circuit Python Express exercise - LAME and SOS in Morse with lights +/- sound

I wanted to do something to learn how to use the leds, buzzer, switch and buttons on the AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express. Couldn't think of anything good, so I decided I'd still do something lame. Hence, the LAME demo. Flashes "LAME" or "SOS" in blue or red, respectively based on which button is pressed. The switch turns on or off the buzzer. OK - it's lame. You were told that up front...
